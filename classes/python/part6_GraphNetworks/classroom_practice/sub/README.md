# ODSC-East2018 and JupyterCon 2018
"Network/Graph Analysis in Python" repository of 3 hours training session held at ODSC East 2018 and JupyterCon 2018.

**Abstract**

Networks, also know as graphs, are one of the most crucial data structures in our increasingly intertwined world. Social friendship networks, the world-wide web, financial systems, infrastructure (power grid, streets), etc. are all network structures. Knowing how to analyze the underlying network topology of interconnected systems can provide an invaluable skill in anyone's toolbox. This training will provide a hands-on guide on how to approach a network analysis project from scratch and end-to-end: how to generate, manipulate, analyze and visualize graph structures that will help you gain insight about relationships between elements in your data.

**Prerequisites**
1.	Installation of NetworkX Python library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx/2.1
2.	We will use Jupyter Notebooks throughout the session: http://jupyter.org/install
3.	A couple of days prior the session the used Jupyter Notebook and data files will be downloadable from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/nderzsy/ODSC-East2018
