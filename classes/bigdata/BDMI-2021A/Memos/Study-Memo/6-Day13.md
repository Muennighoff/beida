### 第1 DeepSpeech

DeepSpeech is an open source embedded (offline, on-device) speech-to-text engine which can run in real time on devices ranging from a Raspberry Pi 4 to high power GPU servers.

### 第2 CTC

Connectionist temporal classification is a type of neural network output and associated scoring function, for training recurrent neural networks such as LSTM networks to tackle sequence problems where the timing is variable. 

### 第3 文本分类

- Use transformer models from huggingface

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
seq = "Hello"
with torch.no_grad():
    print(model(seq))
```
